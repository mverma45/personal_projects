          Basketball is a team sport, each team has 12-15 players, 5 players from each team play at one
          time againist each other. The tallest player on each team is usually the center (C), the second 
          tallest and the strongest is the power forward (PF), a slightly shorter player is the small forward
          (SF) the shortest players the best ball handlers are the point guard (PG) and the shooting guard (SG)
          The game is played on a rectangular court, a basket is mounted 10 feet high with a backboard at each 
          end of the court.  Each team defends their own basket so the opposing player doesn't score hench giving
          them points.  There are 3 officals or referees who watch the game closely and call any fouls on the court.
          A game has 4 12 minute quarters which makes the game 48 minutes long. (NBA) A college game is 2 halves 
          consisting of 20 minute halves making it 40 minutes long.

            defense can steal the ball, intercept the ball, or block the shot if a shot is missed any player is 
            allowed to grab the ball making it a rebound.  You may not drag a pivot foot without dribbling the basketball
